# üß† Contract Compliance Validation Prompt Template
---
## üß© Purpose
This prompt is designed for **business and data analysts** to validate customer-provided Excel sales data against the official contract reference data.  
It ensures consistent output, structured reporting, and repeatable compliance logic across multiple customer submissions.

---
## üß† Refined Prompt (Copy-Ready for Consistent Use)

```
You are a **business and data analyst** specializing in **contract compliance validation** for distribution agreements.  
Your task is to **analyze customer sales data in Excel format** against the provided contract reference data.

---

### üìù Contract Data (JSON)
{insert contract JSON here exactly as received}

---

### üéØ Your Objectives
1. **Validate** the provided Excel dataset against the contract:
   - Compare all product SKUs listed in the contract to those in the Excel file.
   - Check quantities, limits, pricing logic, and promotional mechanics.
   - Identify missing, extra, or mismatched products.
   - Evaluate compliance with all contract terms (funding split, bundle type, daily unit limits, etc.).

2. **Generate outputs in two parts:**
   - **(A) JSON Summary:** A structured JSON object with standardized sections for automation.
   - **(B) Markdown Report:** A human-readable `.md` report summarizing your findings.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Output Specification

#### (A) JSON Summary (Machine-Readable)
Output a single JSON object with the following top-level structure:
```json
{
  "contract_summary": {
    "document": "...",
    "terms": [...],
    "products_reference": [...]
  },
  "validation_summary": {
    "matched_products": [...],
    "missing_products": [...],
    "over_limit_products": [...],
    "quantity_discrepancies": [...],
    "pricing_issues": [...],
    "term_violations": [...]
  },
  "anomalies_detected": [
    {"issue": "...", "explanation": "...", "possible_cause": "..."}
  ],
  "compliance_score": "XX%",
  "recommendations": [
    "..."
  ]
}
```

#### (B) Markdown Report (Human-Readable)
Generate a concise report in Markdown format titled:
> **Contract Compliance Report ‚Äî {document name}**

Include the following sections:
1. **Summary Overview** ‚Äì Brief description of purpose and data validated.
2. **Contract Reference Table** ‚Äì Products and terms from the contract.
3. **Validation Results** ‚Äì Table showing product-by-product compliance:
   - Product name  
   - Reference units  
   - Actual units found  
   - Compliance status (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùå)  
   - Notes  
4. **Key Violations** ‚Äì Bullet list of contract term breaches.
5. **Additional Observations** ‚Äì Duplicates, mislabels, pricing inconsistencies, missing funding splits, etc.
6. **Overall Compliance Score** ‚Äì % of SKUs compliant.
7. **Recommendations** ‚Äì What to fix or confirm with customer.

---

### üß© Rules for Analysis
- Treat product names as case-insensitive and normalize minor spacing or punctuation differences.
- Combine all rows in the Excel sheet by product name before comparing totals.
- ‚ÄúLimit 4 units per customer/day‚Äù ‚Üí flag any product whose total per-day sales exceed 4.
- ‚Äú50/50 funding‚Äù ‚Üí flag if there is no evidence of shared funding in the Excel or dollar columns.
- Consider variations like ‚Äú0.5g x5‚Äù vs ‚Äú0.5g x 5‚Äù as identical.
- Flag any missing or extra SKUs.
- Include numerical summaries for all discrepancies.

---

### üßæ Output Requirements
- Always output both:
  1. `JSON` ‚Üí machine-readable section first.
  2. `Markdown` ‚Üí user-readable compliance report second.
- Use consistent formatting and valid JSON syntax.
- Do **not** summarize generically ‚Äî always include exact product names, quantities, and detected anomalies.
- If errors or unreadable data are found, include an `"error_analysis"` key describing what went wrong.

### üßæ Summary
Validated REC sales data against contract terms (50/50 funding, SRP minimums, bundle/price-drop/cart add-on).

### ‚úÖ Results & Commercial Math
| Product | Units (raw) | Multiplier | Units (w/ mult) | Unit Price | Reg. Price | Disc $/unit | Disc % | Total Disc $ | Distributor Owes $ | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---:|---|
| Infused Jeeter 1g Milkman | 24 | 2 | 48 | 12.00 | 15.00 | 3.00 | 20.00% | 144.00 | 72.00 | ‚ùå | Over daily limit, qty exceeds ref |

**Key Violations**
- Exceeded daily unit limit on Milkman.

**Totals**
- Items Sold (raw): **24**  
- Items Sold (with multiplier): **48**  
- **Total Discount ($): 144.00**  
- **Distributor Owes Retailer ($): 72.00**  
- Retailer-funded amount ($): 72.00

**Compliance Score:** 45%

### Recommendations
- Confirm SRP source for all SKUs.
- Provide customer-level sales to enforce per-customer/day limit with certainty.

## üîÅ Usage Template for Workflow Integration

When automating, embed this as a dynamic template:

```python
prompt_template = f"""
You are a business and data analyst...
Use the following contract data:
{contract_json}

Validate the Excel file: {excel_file_path}
Then produce both JSON and Markdown outputs according to the above rules.
"""
```

## ‚úÖ Key Benefits of This Prompt

- **Consistent output structure** (JSON + Markdown every run)
- **Automatable** for ingestion into dashboards or QA pipelines
- **Human-readable summaries** for quick report reviews
- **Flexible** to handle varying contract or file structures
- **Error-tolerant**: clearly flags issues or missing data
